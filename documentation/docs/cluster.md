FUNCTIONS
    `transform(timeseries: numpy.ndarray)`  
        **Compute the Gramian angular field of a time series.**  
        The Gramian angular field is a bijective transformation of time series data into an image of dimension `n+1`.
        Inserting an `n`-dimensional time series gives an `(n x n)`-dimensional array with the corresponding encoded
        time series data.    
        
        :param timeseries: np.ndarray of time series data.  
        :return :
